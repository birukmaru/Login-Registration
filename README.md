# Login-Registration using MERN


MERN Login and Registration Pages
This project implements a user authentication system with login and registration functionality using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. Users can register for an account, log in with their credentials, and access protected routes.

# Technologies Used

MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user data
Express.js: Backend framework for handling API requests and routes
React: Frontend library for building user interfaces
Node.js: Server-side JavaScript runtime environment
JSON Web Tokens (JWT): For user authentication
Bcrypt: For password hashing

# Features
User registration: Allow users to create a new account by providing their email and password.
User login: Enable users to log in to their accounts using their credentials.
Protected routes: Implement authentication to restrict access to certain routes to authenticated users only.
